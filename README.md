Simple text adventure

This game is a big test for me and my friends who are working with me to develop this game.  Please be patient, as I am currently the only
one working on this project and there is a lot to handle.  Features will be constantly added, so keep checking back to see what is new.
I am also new to GitHub, so bear with me if something doesn't work.  I don't know exactly how this thing works, so if you do know, please
contact me with some help.  To contact me, find me on Reddit  reddit.com/r/topdude155

Thanks!
